ft_prefixgrep: A tool to search for flowtuples that match a given IPv4
prefix.

IMPORTANT: ft_prefixgrep is designed to work with legacy flowtuple files
(i.e. pre-STARDUST) only.


Requirements
============

To build ft_prefixgrep, you'll need the following libraries:
 * libwandio: https://research.wand.net.nz/software/libwandio.php
 * libflowtuple: https://github.com/Merit-Research/libflowtuple

If you are using the STARDUST user environment, these libraries
should already be installed.


Building
========

This should be easy, just run 'make' on the terminal within the
directory containing the ft_prefixgrep source code.


Running
=======

./ft_prefixgrep -f <flowtuple file> -o <output file> -p <prefix> [ -s | -d ]

    -f <flowtuple file> : the legacy flowtuple file to search for your prefix
    -o <output file> : the file to write the found flowtuples into
    -p <prefix>: the prefix to search for, e.g. 1.2.3.0/24
    -s: if set, limit search to source IP addresses only
    -d: if set, limit search to destination IP addresses only

Output is written in a CSV format, one line for flowtuple. The line format is:
  interval timestamp, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port,
  protocol, TTL, TCP flags, IP length, packet count

You can use a combination of bash and gnu parallel to easily process multiple
flowtuple files in parallel. See examplescript.sh for an example of how to do
this.
