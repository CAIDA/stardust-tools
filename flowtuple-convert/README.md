**ftconvert**: converts flowtuple files made using corsaro2 into avro files
conforming to the format used by corsaro3

## Usage

  ftconvert -i <input file> -o <output file>


`<input file>` must be a flowtuple file created by corsaro2 (typically these
will have a suffix of `.cors.gz`).

`<output file>` will be used to name the avro file generated by this program.

## Dependencies

 - libcorsaro3
 - libflowtuple


## Compilation:

Simply run `make` from within the same directory as the ftconvert source code.


## Reading avro files

To dump avro on the command-line, use the avro-tools jar file which you can
download from https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/avro/ -- note that
you will require java to use this jar file.

To dump the avro file to stdout as a series of JSON objects, you can do
something like:

  java -jar avro-tools-<version>.jar tojson <input file>

There are also libraries available for most programming languages to read avro
files.
